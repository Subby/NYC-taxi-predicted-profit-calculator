# NYC Taxi predicted profit calculator
An application written utilising Java and MongoDB to help New York City taxi drivers predict profit from a journey. Built with [Ben Lawton](https://github.com/bltn) as part of the Advanced Database Systems module at Aston University.

## Basic details
This app helps NYC taxi drivers understand how much profit they can make on average by looking at the average fuel price and average fare price. 

It does this by running an aggregation operation on a MongoDB collection populated with [TLC Trip Record Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) and [NYC Gasoline Retail Prices](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/gasoline-retail-prices-weekly-average-by-region-beginning-2007). The front end of the application utilises JavaFX to help make the process user-friendly.
